# Mini-Ear-Trainer

Want to improve your musical ear and unlock the hidden Miles Davis or Charlie Parker whithin you? Look no further. This Python app allows you to train your ear by asking you to play back randomly generated sequences of notes on a piano GUI! This app works for both major and minor keys and is equipped to play in all twelve piano keys. This app was made in Python and uses the tkinter library for the piano GUI, the _thread library for multi-threading, the os.sleep() function for the metronome and the wave library for trimming and concatenating .wav files.
